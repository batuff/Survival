Unix and MacOS X
=================

The *run_example.sh* file contains a script to perform an examplifying simulation, using the approximate implementation of the MKM model.

In the *command line* (from the *install_folder* defined in the setenv.sh file), type:  
`> chmod +x run_example.sh` (execute mode to the *run_example.sh* file)  
`> ./run_example.sh` (launch simulation)

Two files will be created with the simulation results.


Windows

Not supported yet. Work in progress...
