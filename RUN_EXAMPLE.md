Unix and MacOS X
=================

The *run_example.sh* file contains a script to perform an examplifying simulation, using the approximate implementation of the MKM model.

In the *command line* (from the *install_folder* defined in the setenv.sh file), type:  
`> ./run_example.sh` 

Two files will be created with the simulation results.

The script can be changed and modified to perform any kind of simulation supported, see the user's manual (./Documentation/Survival_USERS_MANUAL.pdf) for a full description of the software.


Windows
=================

Not supported yet. Work in progress...
