1) Fix conversion rest_energy <=> kinetic_energy (increase the precision of the mass number)
2) Fix hyperlink and indexing in the reference manual
3) Add and describe templates to:
	- Pass a spectrum (mixed-fields evaluations) - ("spectrum_tmp.txt")
4) Instruction to compile on (or precompiled version for) Windows, and test.
5) Remove warnings during compilation
6) Improve main.cpp (input parsing)
7) Change MeV/µm to keV/µm in input/output and add documentation about it
8) Update README.md
