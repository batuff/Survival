        With respect to the LEM I, the LEM II (\ref LEMII "1") track model is extended to explicitly include the effect of radical diffusion: the previous parametric representation is still used (see Track_Scholz2000) but changing the core radius #R_MIN value from 10 nm to 0.3 nm (value more in agreement with experimental data) in order to represent the instantaneous average ionization pattern which occurs some nanoseconds after the passage of the ion; this pattern is then convoluted with a gaussian kernel of 4 nm sigma that models the spreading of the induced radical species taking place at longer time scales (a few microseconds). Since the computation of the convolution with the gaussian radical diffusion profile is quite time-consuming, one should consider that, except for the outer part of the track, all convoluted track profiles are equal, apart from a normalizing factor depending on the particle LET; hence it is possible to preconvolute once for all this common track profile, called \em master \em curve, shared by all Track_Elsasser2007 instances as a static data member. This class gives also the capability of truncating the track profile providing a dose cut-off.
