        This class inherits from the Nucleus pure virtual class and it has the same structure of the Nucleus_Integral class. It defines the nucleus used in the MCt-MKM model and its peculiarity is to provide some methods to evaluate the temporal effect of the irradiation keeping track of its time structure. Every time an interaction between the nucleus and a particle occurs, the time of the event and the dose deposited are stored in dedicated vectors to be passed at the Nucleus_tMKM class.

The sum of all these lengths is equal to the intersection area and it's overwritten in the correspondent parameter. For each step, defined by a specific radius, the method gets the local dose from the track (Track::getLocalDose()) and the integral is evaluated considering a step function constructed in this way.
